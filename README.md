# Website-Skeleton
This project was used more as applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS and was never meant to be in any actual use.
As said with the comment I mainly wanted to use this as more of applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS, but mostly wanted 
to focus on CSS. I do however like how this turned out and maybe in the future I will make it a fully functional website.
