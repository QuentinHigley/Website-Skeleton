# Website-Skeleton
This project was used more as applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS and was never meant to be in any actual use.
I mostly wanted to focus on Applying CSS to HTML Rather than an equal balance of both so it was never intended 
to become a fully fledged website. I do however like how this turned out and maybe in the future I will make it 
a fully functional website.
